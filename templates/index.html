            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Established in 2015, a quirky little Barbers found on Silver Street in the
                city of York, an apt place for this upcoming, hip Barber shop. Scissorhands began when childhood
                friends, Chris and Nathan, took their childhood dream and made it a reality, soon expanding their
                horizons and knowledge to now being able to train the next generation of Barber prodigies in the way
                of fully funded apprenticeships via Askam Bryan College. The shop itself is a very modern and chic
                place with a laid back atmosphere that caters for all client needs.
